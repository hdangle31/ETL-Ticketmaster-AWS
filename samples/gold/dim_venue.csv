Prices and accepted payment methods are determined by lot owners/operators and can change without notice. We suggest you bring cash and credit/debit card to be best prepared to pay when you arrive. The Colonial Life Arena does not own/operate parking lots/garages. Accessible parking is available. Please look for signage or ask an attendant for availability. In order to park in the spaces reserved for disabled guests, the vehicle must have a state issued handicapped window pass, sticker, or license plate. Guests may drop off a disabled patron near the Colonial Life Arena and park their car in one of the nearby lots. We recommend you arrive early, as the venue is located on campus which is in the city and traffic can often be very heavy in the area.","2024-10-22"
